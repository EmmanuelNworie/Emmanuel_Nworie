# Math6321-codes

Codes for in-class collaboration for the course: Numerical Solution of ODEs (MATH 6321) at Southern Methodist University, for the Fall 2023 semester.

These codes require a modern Python installation.

.. note::

   The `c++` branch includes implementations of the same solvers, but in C++, and that use the "Armadillo" C++ library (http://arma.sourceforge.net) for vectors, matrices, and linear solvers.
