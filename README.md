# Math6321-codes

Codes for in-class collaboration for the course: Numerical Solution of ODEs (MATH 6321) at Southern Methodist University, for the Fall 2020 semester.

These codes require a working C++11-compliant compiler, a working installation of the "Armadillo" C++ library (http://arma.sourceforge.net), and the "make" program, and are designed to be compiled/run at the Linux/OSX command line.
